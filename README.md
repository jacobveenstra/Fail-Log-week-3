# Fail-Log-week-3
struggling with module 1... not sure where to find the information to put into the Regx
just realized that the DBox was down after checking slack... should have checked it much early after trying to log for 20 mins
was able to use a youtube video to figure out how to pull up the nano text for the Texas file
dont really understand the end of step one... what should we be focussing on, and what should we be replacing it with in the text?
Step three is giving me trouble figuring out the expression that is needed so that i cant replace everything but the year
was able to get some help from another classmate to figure out how to do step three
A problem ive had has been that when i have done the commands for index there has been almost no information coming up... i have had to edit the texas.txt for all the steps to work....un sure if this will completely ruin it for me but it has seemed to work so far
trying to save my file from terminal so i can put it on the file cleaning application
figured out how to use the software...very interesting program and had no problems using it once i got my information onto it
